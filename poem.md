# What Grandpa Mouse Said

~~By Tony Graf~~

*By Vachel Lindsay*


The moon's a holy _owl-queen_.<br>
She keeps them in a jar<br>
Under her arm till evening,<br>
Then sallies forth to war.<br>

She pours the _owls_ upon us.<br>
They hoot with horrid noise<br>
And eat the naughty _mousie-girls_<br>
And wicked _mousie-boys_.<br>

So climb the moonvine every night<br>
And to the _owl-queen_ pray:<br>
Leave good green cheese by moonlit trees<br>
For her to take away.<br>

And never squeak, my children,<br>
Nor gnaw the smoke-house door:<br>
The _owl-queen_ then will love us<br>
And send her _birds_ no more.<br>
